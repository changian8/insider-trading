As of the date of market creation, 10-21-20, Dharma has announced their intention to submit a UNI governance proposal on October 23rd, 2020, for essentially airdropping UNI to users who traded on Uniswap through  applications like Dharma, prior to the UNI airdrop snapshot. “Phase 1 includes users of the application integrations”. The Phase 1 proposal can be empirically defined as a UNI governance proposal submitted in late October 2020, that encompasses airdropping UNI retroactively to users of apps that had integrated Uniswap. This market will resolve to “Yes” if this proposal is successfully passed, and “No” in any other case. This market will resolve once the 7 day voting period after the proposal is finished.',\n",
