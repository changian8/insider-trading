# Use Cases

## The Legislator

- Opens the website and reads the story
- They then try to understand our argument, although they might skim and only read titles and pictures
- He then sends the website to his friends so they can read it

## The Degen

- He might read the website, or he might not

- He gets a notification on his phone
- He then reads it, only to understand what to bet on.  Details are not that important to him,
although he might want to know
- He then goes to a trading site of choice and makes a bet based on what we said would work
(possibly we link to polymarket to this easier for them)

(we probably should warn him about the dangers of a gambling addiction)

## The Wise Investor

- He reads the website thoroughly, and he does so to understand our methodology
- He looks at the data so that he can make his own hypotheses about what might be trading

- He gets a notification, but he questions our reasoning before he bets
- So, we redirect him to somewhere he can make his own opinon based on all the available data
- We could (time dependant) make a report, or we can just him to Polymarket if they show the relevant
data in one page
